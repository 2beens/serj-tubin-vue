# VueJS project for serj-tubin.com / 2beens.online

Frontend part of my personal playground site

Hosted at [www.serj-tubin.com](https://www.serj-tubin.com) and/or [2beens.online](https://2beens.online)

### If you want to run and try locally (for whatever reason you might want to do that) 🛠️:

1. make sure you have node, npm and yarn installed
2. yarn install
3. yarn serve-dev
4. note the endpoint in the terminal

Even better if you also run the backend, as described in [2beens/serj-tubin-com](https://github.com/2beens/serj-tubin-com#easiest-way-to-run-it-yes-docker-).

### Disclaimer 🥲
This was my first VueJS project, so it's admittedly suboptimal in some ways and in some parts, but serves my purproses for now, and I am not a frontend developer anyway 🤷‍♂️

I am contemplating rewriting everything with the latest Vue with Typescript or NextJS (which seems quite cool), but there's so many things I'd rather work on (one of them being Rust 🦀 or making music 🎸🥁).
