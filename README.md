1. make sure you have node, npm and yarn installed
2. yarn serve-dev

This was my first VueJS project, so it's suboptimal in many ways in many parts, but serves my purproses for now, and I am not a frontend developer anyway 🤷‍♂️

I am contemplating rewriting everything with the latest Vue with Typescript or NextJS (which seems quite cool), but there's so many things I'd rather work on (one of them being Rust 🦀 or making music 🎸🥁).
