# VueJS project for serj-tubin.com / 2beens.xyz

Frontend part of my personal playground site

Hosted at [www.serj-tubin.com](https://www.serj-tubin.com) and/or [2beens.xyz](https://2beens.xyz)

### If you want to run and try locally (for whatever reason you might want to do that):

1. make sure you have node, npm and yarn installed
2. yarn install
2. yarn serve-dev

This was my first VueJS project, so it's suboptimal in some ways and in some parts, but serves my purproses for now, and I am not a frontend developer anyway 🤷‍♂️

I am contemplating rewriting everything with the latest Vue with Typescript or NextJS (which seems quite cool), but there's so many things I'd rather work on (one of them being Rust 🦀 or making music 🎸🥁).
